To compile, deploy and run the contracts you will need at least NodeJS and yarn:

(npm ubuntu 20.04) https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-install-node-js-on-ubuntu-20-04
(npm macOS m1 -UNTESTED) https://justinwride.medium.com/install-node-and-npm-natively-on-apple-silicon-mac-m1-7432c826389b
(yarn install ubuntu 20.04) https://linuxize.com/post/how-to-install-yarn-on-ubuntu-20-04/
(yarn install macOS m1 - UNTESTED) https://www.codegrepper.com/code-examples/shell/install+yarn+globally+m1+brew

It is not a bad idea to install ganache, especially if you wish to experiment with the private blockchain.

IMPORTANT NOTICE: when following the steps to run the wargame locally, IT IS IMPORTANT to run Step 2 on a SEPARATE TERMINAL. Step 2 sets up the private blockchain, the application CANNOT BE DEPLOYED without it. This is irrelevant if the application runs on Rinkeby or Ropsten.

When deploying locally, you may run into issues. The most important issue occurs after importing a private key through the rpc network (provided by running "yarn network"), executing a challenge and closing the entire application (terminating the rpc blockchain and the application). After restarting and using the same address, you may receive "Nonce Too High" error when running a transaction, making it impossible to receive new instances.. The way to fix this is to reset your MetaMask account. Details can be found here:

This was tested for MetaMask on Brave and worked fine.
